About Dataset
Context
Identifying emotions has become an integral part of many NLP and data science projects. With the help of this dataset, one can train and build various robust models and perform emotional analysis.

Content
Manual annotation of the dataset to obtain real-valued scores was done through Best-Worst Scaling (BWS), an annotation scheme shown to obtain very reliable scores (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016). The data is then split into a training set and a test set.
